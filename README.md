For the answer of question 2a, 2b, 2c please run the pyton file.  
2d) Ideally if we want to keep the AND gate and OR gate work perfectly then when the input increase the bias should be adjust depends on the number of input. Which mean bk = -n if we want the neuron produce AND gate and bk = -1 if we want the OR gate. However, here we already give a constraint such that if bk < -3 the neutron always in the quiesent state and if bk > -1 the neuron always in the firing state.
